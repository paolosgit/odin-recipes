        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>What makes Thai curry so delicious is that it is the perfect blend of sweet, spicy and savory.
            The coconut milk-base is not too thick and goes great with a spoonful of rice. In the curry is often a choice of meat
            such as chicken or pork as well as vegetables, namely chopped bamboo shoots.
